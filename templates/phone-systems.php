            <p class="flow-text bold">Take advantage of efficiencies associated with IP-based communications and Voice Over IP services.</p>
            <p>VoIP provides services that may be more difficult to implement or more expensive with traditional telephone systems. Examples include:</p>
            <ul class="collection">
              <li class="collection-item">The ability to transmit more than one telephone call over the same broadband connection. This can make VoIP a simple way to add an extra telephone line to a home or office.</li>
              <li class="collection-item">Conference calling, call forwarding, automatic redial, and caller ID; zero- or near-zero-cost features that traditional telecommunication companies (telcos) normally charge extra for.</li>
              <li class="collection-item">Secure calls using standardized protocols (such as Secure Real-time Transport Protocol.) Most of the difficulties of creating a secure phone connection over traditional phone lines, like digitizing and digital transmission, are already in place with VoIP. It is only necessary to encrypt and authenticate the existing data stream.</li>
              <li class="collection-item">Location independence. Only an Internet connection is needed to get a connection to a VoIP provider. For instance, call center agents using VoIP phones can work from anywhere with a sufficiently fast and stable Internet connection.</li>
              <li class="collection-item">Integration with other services available over the Internet, including video conversation, message or data file exchange in parallel with the conversation, audio conferencing, managing address books, and passing information about whether others (e.g. friends or colleagues) are available to interested parties.</li>
              <li class="collection-item">Advanced Telephony features such as call routing, screen pops, and IVR implementations are easier and cheaper to implement and integrate. The fact that the phone call is on the same data network as a user’s PC opens a new door to possibilities.</li>
