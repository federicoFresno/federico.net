Family and neighborhood friends recognized his abilities and would have him fix radios, bikes, or anything mechanical. This led him as teenager to work as a diesel truck mechanic with a specialty in electrical repairs. He moved onto working on aircraft mechanics doing maintenance, rebuilding, and repairing planes and helicopters. He received his degree from California State University Fresno with a degree in Business Administration with an option in Urban Land Economics. Jim got his real estate appraisal license and worked in the real estate industry concurrently while working as Director of Operations for a locally family owned company in Fresno. Hired to assist with the day to day operations of the business, his passion for all things mechanical eventually led him to begin providing IT support for the operationâ€™s data network. It was during this time in 1993 that he realized his true calling and Federico Consulting was born.<p>The company came from humble beginnings with Jim working out of his garage for a handful of clients. Eventually the company outgrew the garage and Jim moved operations to the current office building. After the dust had settled, Jim and his wife Lisa started their family. They have two children: Jacob and Lauren.<p>Jim stays up to date on the latest IT trends; he prides himself on always being ahead of the curve when it comes to all things technology related. Jim has is C-7 Low Voltage Contractors License as well as holding many certifications from industry leaders including Microsoft (MCSE), Avaya, Nortel, Citrix CCEA MetaFrame Presentation Server, and CCA MetaFrame Presentation Server. Jim is always looking for ways to expand and improve his skillset.<p>Fast forward over 20 years and you will find a highly successful and diversified company being led by someone who will never forget where he started. All along, Jim has been focused on what matters most: the customer. Federico Consulting clients come from a wide range of industries, but they all have one thing in common: their technology works for them, not against them. Whether a client needs their building cabled, their phone system replaced, their data network tuned up, or just to consult with someone regarding their infrastructure, Jim is always eager to assist. His diligence, attention to detail, and insight make up the foundation of Federico Consulting.<p>Jim enjoys spending his valuable time off with his family, traveling, and being in the outdoors in his Jeep on mountain trails or on the dunes. His son graduated from Santa Clara University in 2018, and his daughter attends Point Loma Nazarene University.</div></div></div></div><div class=spacer-50></div><div class="section grey-white-diag-grad partner-section"><img src=img/hex-bottom.png class=hex-border><h4 class="text-darken-2 blue-grey-text center">We Partner with the Best</h4><div class=row><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www.avaya.com"><img src=img/partners/ayava.png class=partner-image alt="Avaya"></a></div><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www.cisco.com"><img src=img/partners/cisco.png class=partner-image alt="Cisco"></a></div><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com"><img src=img/partners/mssilver.png alt="Microsoft Silver Small and Midmarket Cloud Solutions Partner" height="200" class=partner-image></a></div><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com"><img src=img/partners/msed.png class=partner-image alt="Microsoft Education Partner"></a></div><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www8.hp.com"><img src=img/partners/msfl.png class=partner-image alt="Microsoft Frontline Partner"></a></div><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www.eset.com"><img src=img/partners/eset.png alt="ESET" height="125" class=partner-image></a></div><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www8.hp.com"><img src=img/partners/hp_business_partner.png alt="HP Products, HP Support" height="125" class=partner-image></a></div><div class="col s12 l3 m4"><a href="https://www.hpe.com"><img src=img/partners/HPE-Business-Partner-Logo.png height="125" alt="HPE Business Partner" class=partner-image></div></div><div class=spacer-20></a></div></div>
